## Auto Merge Script

Script for auto merging branches with master

Usage:

* Update `BRANCHES` array with the branches you need to merge with(not into) master
* Run the script `./auto_update_branches.sh`
* Branches are updated

Use this script if you are sure there are no conflicts since script does not process conflict cases.
